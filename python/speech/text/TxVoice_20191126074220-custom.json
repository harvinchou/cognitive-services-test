					"Display": "How are you? Fine. Thank you and you. Please remember me to Tom. Say hello to Tom. How do you do? It's nice to meet you. Where are you from? We can do better. I think it's time for us to leave now. See you later. It's very kind of you. Thank you all the same. Happy birthday to you. I'm sorry to hear that. I'm sorry to have kept you waiting for a long time. That's alright. What time can I see you? That's a good idea. Can I talk to you? How are you feeling today? Are you available on Friday night to have dinner? Could you scan the documents and email them to me? A lack of sleep will have a detrimental effect on your health. On second thought could I get an iced coffee instead of a hot coffee. He needs to leave 1/4 after 4. My parents are coming to visit next week. You are over 30 and he still don't have a credit card. What a deal these shoes are only $20? Can you sing me a reminder about the appointment? Plane was delayed for more than 4 hours. The novel epitomizes the problems of working class women in the 1950s. In her memoir, Michelle Obama draws on her experiences as the first lady. I'm going to add in one teaspoon of granulated sugar as well as 1/8 of a teaspoon or 1/4 teaspoon. Of Cinnamon, The first lag was 10 hours and the second lag was 12 hours. Our layover ended up being in Frankfurt, Germany. Which was really exciting because I'm a big fan of kinder products? And just German food in general. That's a reclining chair nice comfortable, couch glass table TV with a PS4 and some video games. Smoked salmon is quite popular cucumber and cream cheese is ever so popular as well. You wanna do that new Thai place again. It was pretty tasty last time. Monday is totally doable showing me at the usual spot. I don't really mind getting take out it's too hot, to cook anyway. When a team of archaeologists recently came across some 15,000 year old human remains. They made an interesting. The teeth of those ancient humans were riddled with holes. And as our teeth erupt. They naturally begin to accumulate communities of bacteria. Depending on what we eat and specifically how much sugar, we consume certain microbes can overpopulate and cause cavities. Diets high in sugary foods. Cause an explosion of bacteria called mutans streptococci in our mouths. Like humans, these microorganisms love sugar. Using it as a molecular building block and energy source. Gradually acid wears down a pathway for bacteria into the tooth's secondary layer called the dentin. Today, an incredible 92% of American adults have had cavities in their teeth. In most toothpastes and many water supplies, we use tiny amounts of fluoride. Gradually the population of sugar loving microbes in your mouth will decline."
